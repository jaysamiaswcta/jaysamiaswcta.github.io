                <br> Discover momentous music and travel the world. Meet new people and unearth the different cultures. Understand different religions. Communicate with others in another language, even if it’s obvious the knowledge of everything is absent.”

            <p>“A euphoric atmosphere is conceived
                <br>And no one's recognition of progress
                <br> but her own is sufficient.
                <br>
                <br> It's as if adventure and experience
                <br> Had combed through her soul,
                <br>Detangling the damage.
                <br>
                <br> She wastes fallen lashes and 11:11's
                <br> On world peace, in hopes that her wishes will
                <br> Wisp unmindlessly for all to feel.
                <br>
                <br> Exchanging sorry and suicide notes
                <br> For love letters strictly intended for the world
                <br> All she comes across drives her.”

Teaching you to be<br>
productive in every endeavor,<br>
through which you should learn<br>
Circa forever.<br>
<br>
Although the lesson may not be realized immediately,<br>
commemorate everything you have done,<br>
for your actions shaped you into the person you are today.<br>
<br>
Yin and yang come with simple rules:
<br>
One.<br>
Love.<br>
Love everything.<br>
Appreciate every aspect of everything.<br>
Like… everything.<br>
An open mind calls for a well rounded attitude.<br><br>

Two.<br>
Marinate in a culture not native to you.<br>
Let the foreign words hit you like boulders,<br>
waking you up,<br>
opening your eyes to this<br>
tubular planet and it’s diversity.<p style="font-style: italic; text-align: right;">Creative Writing Poem

            <p>“Feminism is not about man-hating or female supremacy. It is, by definition, the opposite. It’s pretty simple really: if you believe in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes, you’re a feminist”. Ed Holmen goes on to say that “we must all make an active decision to change our language.”. When the issue of feminism is discussed, men are unheard of. The lack of male attention can often leave a bad taste in the mouth of a third party because of this assumption of, again, “female supremacy” and leads to the misconceptions of feminism.
